# Projet Hangman B1 Info

I am glad to present this hangman project done in Golang during my first semester.
I did this assignment with Rihem's collaboration in the very begining, but finished alone due to her changing studies.

The game is fairly simple and straightforward:
    - when running the game, you can import your own list of words putting the path as an argument (be careful with the file's format: it must be .txt and with a word per line, without accents, signs or spaces)
    - when ingame, you are led by the menus to change the parameters, view the top scores, or start a new game
    - it's important to keep the files in the order/path in which they are here, e.g. hangman.txt, and the dictionaries
    - don't touch to config.txt or scores.txt if you don't know what you are doing
    - some errors are explained when they occur (hopefully not, of course)
    - be careful of the terminal's size, because the game's display is fixed: it mustn't be too little
